# Gridium Data Exploration

As a code sample for an interview, I've produced a script which simply loads, parses, and CSV-ifies some fields of interest from a provided XML file. As I needed to examine the XML document, I did most of the work iteratively in a Jupyter notebook. 

To gather requirements for the scripts use
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the notebook or the standalone script which acheives the same goal, use
```bash
python parseToCSV.py
```
OR
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
